## Component Usage
### Default

A default badge is a basic UI element showing small information, typically with a standard design and color, used for notifications or status indicators.

<SBadge client:only="vue" class="mt-4" />
<Code code={SBadgeRaw} lang="vue" title="defaultBadge.vue" />

### Rounded

A rounded badge is a UI element with a circular or rounded design used to display information or status. It typically features a curved edge and is used for notifications or indicators.

<SBadgeRounded client:only="vue" class="mt-4" />
<Code code={SBadgeRoundedRaw} lang="vue" title="roundedBadge.vue" />

### Closable

A closable badge is a UI element that can be dismissed or removed by the user, often with a close button or icon. It is used for notifications or alerts that users can clear from view.

<SBadgeClosable client:only="vue" class="mt-4" />
<Code code={SBadgeClosableRaw} lang="vue" title="closableBadge.vue" />
